# Runestone

Runestone is a text adventure game written in (GNU) Prolog.  It's inspired by classic text adventures like _Zork_.  I'm writing it to sharpen my Prolog skills, learn a little about parsing, and basically bring meaning to my life tbh I don't have a whole lot going on.  Soon I'll release this and it'll set the world afire and bring in the big bucks ðŸ˜Ž

## How to Play

To play Runestone, you will need to have a Prolog interpreter installed on your computer. Once you have installed Prolog, you can run the game by loading the `runestone.pl` file into the interpreter and executing the `start` predicate.  I don't know how it's gonna work after that.  Let's find out together.
